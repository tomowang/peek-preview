Peek Preview is a browser extension that allows you to preview the contents of a
webpage before you open it in a new tab.

[![marquee](./store/promotional-marquee.png)](https://youtu.be/s3XLsu8M1LY "Peek Preview Demo")

Features:

-   Preview links in current tab or popup window
-   Use shift⇧ + click link or drag link to open links for peek preview
-   Press Esc or just blur the preview window to close it

Known issues:

-   Some websites may not work properly due to `onfetch` handler of [service workers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#interact-w-service-workers)
-   Some websites disable the drag event or shift⇧ + click event, so you can't use them to open links for peek preview
-   Links may not work properly when they redirect to another sites which have Content Security Policy (CSP) enabled

This project is created by command `pnpm dlx wxt@latest init`
